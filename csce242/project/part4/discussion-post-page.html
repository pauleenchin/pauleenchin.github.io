                <p id="forum-content">
                    Hey duelists! With the latest banlist changes and new support cards coming out, do you think Branded Despia is still a top-tier deck? ðŸ¤”
                    <br><br>I've been testing it against Kashtira and Tearlaments, and while it still has strong plays, I feel like it struggles against disruption-heavy decks. Hand traps like Droll & Lock Bird, Ash Blossom, and Nibiru can really slow it down, and with the rise of backrow-heavy control decks, Iâ€™m wondering if Branded Despia can keep up.

                    <br><br>Key Strengths of Branded Despia in 2025:
                    <br> - Consistent Fusion Plays â€“ Thanks to Branded Fusion, the deck can still summon Mirrorjade or other boss monsters turn 1.
                    <br> - Graveyard Setup â€“ The deck naturally sets up follow-up plays and can grind well.
                    <br> - Branded in Red + Guardian Chimera â€“ Still a powerful disruption and draw engine.
                    <br>
                    <br><br>Potential Weaknesses:
                    <br> - Vulnerable to Hand Traps â€“ Ash, Droll, and Evenly Matched can really hurt this deckâ€™s plays.
                    <br> - Struggles Against Fast OTK Decks â€“ Dragon Link, Mathmech, and even some Spright builds can outpace it.
                    <br> - Limited Defensive Options â€“ Besides Branded Expulsion loops, it relies on boss monsters for control.
